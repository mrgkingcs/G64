# G64
An unusably-embryonic VM system for supporting ASM programming at KS4/5 

## The plan
Teaching ASM at A-level is dry and difficult to make meaningful.  LMC is great, and there are AQA assembler apps out there, but these are limited in their application to software engineering projects.

The idea of this project is to make a VM based around a simplified Commodore 64 / 6510 CPU.  That would allow simple assembly programs to draw directly to the screen, making things immediately more engaging.  Simple count-controlled loops could draw lines of characters, and perhaps even using tools for C64 retro-development, full games could be made.
